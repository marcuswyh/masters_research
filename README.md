# Masters Research
## AR Research Project for Masters

Augmented reality devices have been gaining momentum in recent years especially in the area of assistive technology, particularly targeted towards assisting visually impaired individuals in navigating around unknown indoor areas.  With visual information being a key factor in efficient navigational tasks, visually impaired individuals are in dire need of an intuitive and accessible solution to improve their visual senses.  This research will be focused upon leveraging existing Augmented Reality (AR) technologies such as the Microsoft HoloLens to improve object visibility and distinguish-ability for users suffering from Glaucoma in indoor areas of low color contrast, with stairs being the main object of focus in this project.  This was achieved by using deep learning based object detection models  such  as  YOLO  (You  Only  Look  Once)  for  stairs  detection  and  Probabilistic Hough Line Transform for stairs step counting.
