Augmented reality devices have been gaining momentum in recent years especially inthe area of assistive technology, particularly targeted towards assisting visually impairedindividuals in navigating around unknown indoor areas.  With visual information beinga key factor in efficient navigational tasks, visually impaired individuals are in dire needof an intuitive and accessible solution to improve their visual senses.  This research willbe focused upon leveraging existing Augmented Reality (AR) technologies such as theMicrosoft HoloLens to improve object visibility and distinguish-ability for users sufferingfrom Glaucoma in indoor areas of low color contrast, with stairs being the main objectof focus in this project.  This was achieved by using deep learning based object detectionmodels  such  as  YOLO  (You  Only  Look  Once)  for  stairs  detection  and  ProbabilisticHough Line Transform for stairs step counting.
